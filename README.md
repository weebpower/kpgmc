# kpgmc.tk 
**/kpg/ minecraft**: The best minecraft server for the best 4chan general.
This is the server exactly as it runs on my computer. At any time, you can download this repository and play on the exact same world as kpgmc at the time of the last commit. Feel free to import it into a singleplayer save or start your own server.

# Why?
So you can play with no worries that the server will suddenly go offline. No fear of losing your hours of progress and autistic building since it's all saved here, forever (or at least until github goes under).
