[03:24:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> but yeah we need fireworks to actually fly
[03:24:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> a mob farm would be cool

[03:29:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> hahahaha

[03:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> oh
[03:41:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> ;D

[03:42:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> hell yeah
[03:42:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> it압 a nice mindfuck
[03:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i love how its so raw
[03:42:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> indeed!!
[03:42:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> like the entire show kind of feels empty in a good way
[03:43:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I understand what you mean
[03:43:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> it압 a lite version of Lain, if you watched that too
[03:43:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> ive never heard of it
[03:43:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> Serial Experiments Lain?
[03:43:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> nope...
[03:43:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> Damn youre in for a treat
[03:43:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I think so at least
[03:43:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> whats it about
[03:43:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> maybe that one gets a little TOO weird but I like that
[03:43:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> akira weird?
[03:44:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> ...i havent watched akira yet
[03:44:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> yeah i know im all backwards
[03:44:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> it was fucking strange
[03:44:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i didnt like it personally but idk maybe i just didnt get it
[03:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> lain is supposedly about a teenage girl that fuses with the internet or something
[03:45:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> but it압 very abstract and postmodern
[03:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> so it압 all over the place
[03:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> that sounds kind of cool
[03:45:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I liked it a lot
[03:45:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> its like that one song uh
[03:45:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> home
[03:45:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i think
[03:45:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> no...
[03:45:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> it was a different name
[03:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> fuck this is going to annoy me
[03:46:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> >.> damn wish I knew

[03:46:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> thats the name

[03:48:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i thought its a general term
[03:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I dont see the initialism much

[03:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> huh
[03:48:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> yeah not a big difference but
[03:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> or maybe I앐 wrong
