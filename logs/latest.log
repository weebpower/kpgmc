[03:23:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> matching
[03:23:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> so you cant wear chest armor with this on?

[03:24:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> nice
[03:24:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> but yeah we need fireworks to actually fly
[03:24:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> a mob farm would be cool
[03:24:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> lots of tnt
[03:24:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> yessir

[03:28:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I have plenty seeds
[03:28:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> rip my zombie villager bro died
[03:28:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> you can plant some seeds then put a load of bonemeal on them
[03:29:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> ye
[03:29:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> this place needs some water
[03:29:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> are you making a moat?
[03:29:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> what
[03:29:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> hahahaha
[03:29:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I think that would make it too unfriendly
[03:29:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> but something nice with water
[03:30:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> ok
[03:30:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> farm out back?

[03:32:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> should we keep him?
[03:32:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> of course

[03:32:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> what should we name him
[03:32:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i need levels first to name it

[03:41:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> but I have watched some yes
[03:41:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> my favorite is Evangelion
[03:41:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> whats your favourite?
[03:41:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> oh
[03:41:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> ;D
[03:41:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> good show im watching it rn actually
[03:42:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> hell yeah
[03:42:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> it´s a nice mindfuck
[03:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i love how its so raw
[03:42:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> indeed!!
[03:42:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> like the entire show kind of feels empty in a good way
[03:43:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I understand what you mean
[03:43:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> it´s a lite version of Lain, if you watched that too
[03:43:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> ive never heard of it
[03:43:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> Serial Experiments Lain?
[03:43:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> nope...
[03:43:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> Damn you´re in for a treat
[03:43:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I think so at least
[03:43:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> whats it about
[03:43:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> maybe that one gets a little TOO weird but I like that
[03:43:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> akira weird?
[03:44:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> ...i havent watched akira yet
[03:44:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> yeah i know im all backwards
[03:44:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> it was fucking strange
[03:44:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i didnt like it personally but idk maybe i just didnt get it
[03:45:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> lain is supposedly about a teenage girl that fuses with the internet or something
[03:45:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> but it´s very abstract and postmodern
[03:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> so it´s all over the place
[03:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> that sounds kind of cool
[03:45:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I liked it a lot
[03:45:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> its like that one song uh
[03:45:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> home
[03:45:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i think
[03:45:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> no...
[03:45:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> it was a different name
[03:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> fuck this is going to annoy me
[03:46:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> >.> damn wish I knew
[03:46:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> SHELTER
[03:46:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> thats the name
[03:47:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> cant think of a song with that name
[03:47:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> its a cool mv
[03:47:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> you should waatch it
[03:47:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> oh it´s kpop!!! nice.
[03:47:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> ok ok
[03:47:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> nope...
[03:47:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> OH

[03:48:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> context....

[03:48:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> mv
[03:48:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i thought its a general term
[03:48:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> I dont see the initialism much
[03:48:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> usually in western music I see it spelled out
[03:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> huh
[03:48:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> yeah not a big difference but
[03:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> or maybe I´m wrong
[03:49:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> no i think youre right
[03:49:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tirazi> i didnt see "mv" before i got into kpop
[03:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <edeak> yeah that was what I was considering too
